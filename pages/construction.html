      The Bb (flat) trumpet is made from tubes of brass wrapped in oblong shapes. Sound is made by blowing air through the
      lips and make a buzzing sound at the same time. The air travels all thorughout the trumpet and comes out the bell of
      the instrument. When the valves are pressed, it reroutes the air into different length tubes. This changes the distance
      the air has to travel, thus affecting the pitch that is produced. Tuning can also be done by either pulling out or
      pushing in the tuning slide to make the pitch lower or higher respectively.
