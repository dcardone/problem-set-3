      The trumpet is one of the most notorius instruments in the world. It's unique
      sound has made it easily recognizable in a band and one of the most popular
      instruments for beginner musicians.

    <p>
      The earliest metal trumpets are thought to have been made around 1500 BC.
      Trumpets made of bronze and silver were found in King Tut's grave. This,
      however, is not necessarily the origin of people creating sound by blowing
      through something. There are records of people in early civilizations
      blowing through conch shells or other shells to create sound. This picture below demonstrates
      some of the earliset types of trumpet-like instruments.
